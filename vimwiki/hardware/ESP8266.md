```bash

pythom3 -m pip install esptool

short pin 0 to GND for first flash!

GPIO 15 (pin D8) may not be high during boot!

Label	GPIO	Input		Output		Notes
D0	GPIO16	no interrupt	no PWM or I2C	HIGH at boot used to wake up from deep sleep
D1	GPIO5	OK		OK		often used as SCL (I2C)
D2	GPIO4	OK		OK		often used as SDA (I2C)
D3	GPIO0	pulled up	OK		connected to FLASH button, boot fails if pulled LOW
D4	GPIO2	pulled up	OK		HIGH at boot connected to on-board LED, boot fails if pulled LOW
D5	GPIO14	OK		OK		SPI (SCLK)
D6	GPIO12	OK		OK		SPI (MISO)
D7	GPIO13	OK		OK		SPI (MOSI)
D8	GPIO15	pulled to GND	OK		SPI (CS) Boot fails if pulled HIGH
RX	GPIO3	OK		RX pin		HIGH at boot
TX	GPIO1	TX pin		OK		HIGH at boot debug output at boot, boot fails if pulled LOW
A0	ADC0	Analog Input	X

You can either use GPIO1/3 pins with UART0 (which are normal pins you use to upload the sketch), or call Serial.swap(); in your setup() function, which changes the UART pins to use GPIO13 and GPIO15 as RX and TX.
